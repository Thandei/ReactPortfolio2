                Hi everyone! I'm Ufuk studying "Translation and Interpretation" in Hacettepe University. Along with educational background, I also interested and experienced in Web development, IT support.

Having strong communication skills and wonder insight made me pursue a career path including IT and Web Development with Translation. So it was not surprise to me that I inclined to the shining software world.

Now, I've been serving as a freelancer in IT world and self-taught developer while improving myself on other educational sides.
